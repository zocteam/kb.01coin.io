# Minutes

## Agenda Item: Verification of vision and mission statement

**Discussion and Conclusions:**
- The zocteam is still 100% committed to original mission and vision statement as articulated in the *ZOC Takeover and Change Proposal*
- 01coin is on track to realize its goal to become "the most community-centric project in all of crypto" this year
- This will be accomplished using a new core source from Dash and the long-promised, custom-designed governance voting system

**Action Items:**
- None

## Agenda Item: Core update

**Discussion and Conclusions:**
- Despite ongoing development and customization to our core code, 01coin has outgrown the Dash 0.12 core upon which it is currently based
- The Dash 0.12 version also does not include the Dash Improvement Proposal ("DIP") required to for us to develop the 01coin governance system
- Masternodes in the most recent Dash cores (up to version 0.15 now) are fully distinct from existing 01coin masternodes
- A choice must be made: proceed directly to the latest Dash code, in which case a hard fork is required – OR – do what Dash did and enable an interim core based on Dash 0.13 that supports both masternode types, fire an eventual spork to disable the old masternode protocol, and then merge our code thereafter with the latest Dash upgrade
- The zocteam decided to take the latter route with iterative upgrades
- Reasons for this choice include: iterative upgrades make problem-solving and bug-finding easier than attempting it all at once; furthermore, our exchange partners will be likely to cooperate with us through multiple wallets updates over time, but less likely to cooperate (without charging fees) in the event of a hard fork
- If development of the 01coin governance voting system is possible with a core based on Dash 0.13, then its creation will precede the next core merge to the latest Dash (currently 0.15, but conceivably a later version by the time this upgrade becomes necessary)
- So the major milestones in core development are, in order: 1) Merge 01coin with Dash 0.13, 2) Fire spork to disable old masternode protocol, 3) Develop custom governance voting system, 4) Merge 01coin with whatever the latest Dash version is at the time

**Action Items:**
- Merge the ZOC core with Dash 0.13 w/ support dor dual MN protocols; *Responsibility:* OwenRay; *Deadline:* March
- Test and release new wallet version; *Responsibility:* OwenRay, cmelx; *Deadline:* April
- Fire spork to disable old masternode protocol; *Responsibility:* OwenRay; *Deadline:* TBD based on adoption rates

## Agenda Item: Governance voting system

**Discussion and Conclusions:**
- It remains 01coin's vision to create a governance voting system wherein the following conditions are met: 1) All governance votes are conducted in a distributed manner using the wallet, including GUI governance via the QT version, 2) Governance votes are dependent on a representative sample of community members, and therefore not skewed towards the ZOC "elite" or "whales," and 3) One coin is worth one vote in governance, and voting is open to all wallet holders, not just masternode operators
- Work on developing governance will begin as soon as the core has the technical requirements to support it

**Action Items:**
- Design, test and release new wallet version with governance; *Responsibility:* OwenRay, cmelx; *Deadline:* June-July

## Agenda Item: 01VPS.net status

**Discussion and Conclusions:**
- Despite personnel overlap, 01coin and 01VPS.net remain wholly distinct albeit interrelated projects
- The zocteam personnel with responsibilities in 01VPS.net are fully aware of the performance problems the product current suffers from, we have diagnosed the problem, and we have completed tests on multiple potential solutions
- The recent maintenance window aims to resolve the performance problems once and for all
- If the recent maintenance window is successful, 01VPS.net will have managed to successfully upgrade its hardware architecture from the old system at approximately one-fifth the overall operating cost, thus ensuring its continued and future sustainability
- If not – further hypotheses and tests will be proposed; there is absolutely no discussion at this stage about mothballing 01VPS.net

**Action Items:**
- Complete tasks related to current 01VPS.net maintenance window; *Responsibility:* Evydder; *Deadline:* March
- Rewnew 01VPS.net marketing drive; *Responsibility:* deadthings; *Deadline:* March-April

## Agenda Item: Relevance of 01VPS.net to 01coin

**Discussion and Conclusions:**
- Despite 01VPS.net and 01coin continuing to be distinct projects, 01VPS.net is an important contributor to 01coin
- Not only does 01VPS.net support the 01coin economy, it also supports various 01coin products including its Discord bot and its blockchain explorer
- Thus it is in 01coin's own best interest to ensure that 01VPS.net can operate with high performance and full functionality in a sustainable way

**Action Items:**
- None

## Agenda Item: Potential core modifications

**Discussion and Conclusions:**
- There was some discussion concerning modifications to the core involving block rewards
- Currently, block rewards are scheduled to be paid to miners and masternodes at a rate of 50% each, with block rewards declining by roughly 12% per year
- 01coin remains committed to offering the crypto and masternode community and affordably entrypoint into masternodes, however, we also appreciate many members of the community have long been asking for a tiered masternode system to help reduce operating overhead
- This would require a fundamental change to the block reward structure at the core level
- An example of a potential change articulated during the call was to offer a 1000-coin "masternode" followed by a 10000-coin "supernode" followed by a 100000-coin "meganode"
- Development of a tiered masternode system upon a merged 01coin / Dash 0.13 or later codebase is feasible
- If we are amending block reward code anyway, some additional discussion was made concerning the adding of a development fund
- A block-reward-level dev fund would exist in addition to a project-and-governance-based fund raised in superblocks pending the results of a vote
- The purpose of the modest block-reward-level dev fund would be to pay for basic services related to 01coin such as the domain and web host and therefore would not be expected to constitute a significant sum over the course of a year
- The zocteam concluded that no changes to the block reward structure were warranted prior to the implementation of governance, thus any potential changes will be put to a vote prior to implementation

**Action Items:**
- None

# Other Information

**Observers:** None  
**Special notes:** In conclusion, the immediate-term priorities for 01coin are to merge our code with Dash 0.13 and enable both the new and the existing masternode protocols. We will then use marketing and social media to entice the community to upgrade prior to firing a spork to disable old masternodes. Once 01coin's core has been fully upgraded, work will begin on the development of a new governance system concomitant alongside work to fix any emergent bugs from the 0.13 release and work to upgrade our core to the latest Dash release at the time. Thus, we envision at least two new wallet versions prior to delivering the version of 01coin that was originally promised to the community in the *ZOC Takeover and Change Proposal*. Upon delivery of this eventual wallet version, the zocteam will consider its job complete, and the future of the project will rest entirely in the hands of the community as intended.
