Welcome to 01coin's Anthology of Activity - our biweekly project update. After the last project update featuring our new wallet release, we figured this update would be pretty sparse by comparison. Not the case!

Lots has been going on within the 01coin Community, so read on to bring yourself up to speed.

# Community Updates

- Another new update; another new exchange listing! 01coin has a new BTC trading pair available on Crex24 at https://crex24.com/exchange/ZOC-BTC
- The 0.2 BTC listing fee (graciously discounted from Crex24's normal 0.3 for 01coin) was paid for out of the [community donation wallet](https://www.blocktrail.com/BTC/address/33aoJAthELcSGsYZJXxV8PAHVYiDECPuJR)
- 01coin is now trading live on [Crex24](https://crex24.com/exchange/ZOC-BTC), [Graviex](https://graviex.net/markets/zocbtc), [Ubit](https://ubit.pw/markets/zocbtc) and [Bisq](https://markets.bisq.network/?market=zoc_btc)
- Note that 01coin's CryptalDash integration was scheduled for deployment on Sept. 21, but this deadline has obviously been missed. In our last communication with CryptalDash on the 21st, they assured us that all BTC-based coins had been tested and were ready for deployment. So we are unsure what the hold up is. We will continue to pester them until we get a straight answer
- Participated in the Bisq Market Kick-Start Day on Sept. 20. As of this writing, there are currently 21 open offers in the [ZOC/BTC orderbook](https://markets.bisq.network/?market=zoc_btc), the most of *any* cryptocurrency on the Bisq platform

<p style="text-align: center;">The ZOC orderbook nearly doubled in size on Bisq Market Kick-Start Day</p>

- Participated in an airdrop with [dice-age.com](https://dice-age.com/) who are giving away 10 ZOC to contest participants
- Added a new masternode monitoring service on [Mintnodes.com](https://www.mintnodes.com/coins/ZOC). Mintnodes is more than just a masternode monitoring service - it also hosts what they call "Clusternodes" for several other coins (not ZOC, though). Definitely worth checking out
- Also added a listing on [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/01coin). CoinGecko a popular online crypto listing and price conversion tool, it also offers handy mobile apps for iOS and Android to help you keep track of your crypto holdings and discover new opportunities
- Our [Gleam campaign](https://gleam.io/VgCdZ/01-coin-lets-spread-the-word-about-zoc) has continued, and it has so far generated a total of 54 entries. The deadline to enter is six days from now
- Co-marketing effort alongside [01VPS.net](https://01vps.net/), targeting the Oyster Platform, Scribe, Rapture, Global Token, BanKitt and Nodium communities, including this tweet on Sept. 19, International Talk Like a Pirate Day:

- The community content creation competition (4C) for *"How to Register on Graviex and Start Trading ZOC"* elicited its first entry, thanks [Alt]oshi! Look for the 01coin Community's first video tutorial on YouTube in the next week or so

# Wallet and Core Development

- Successfully passed the softfork at Block 120000 without issue, introducing [BIP34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki), [BIP65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki) and [BIP66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki) to the 01coin blockchain.

<p style="text-align: center;">An uneventful softfork is a successful softfork</p>

- Discovered a bug in the new 0.12.3.2 code that causes a hardlock in masternodes. Note that this bug does not affect regular nodes.
- Used a full threadstack trace to hunt down the root cause and found it is also present in the current Dash code, so…

> - Contacted the Dash team to discuss the issue
> - Tried to implement a solution recommended by the Dash team, but it failed testing
> - Currently testing a custom solution developed entirely by the zocteam
> - If current testing proves successful, new wallet patch will be released within a few days; if testing fails, though, we will have to try something else. Note that no timetable estimate can be provided in the event the current round of testing fails

- Reached a blockchain threshold wherein Sentinel is now required to run a 01coin masternode
- Forked Sentinel from Dash and made the minimum modifications required for compatibility with 01coin in order to deploy it to users as quickly as possible
- Continue to develop Sentinel and customize it for use with 01coin
- Created a Sentinel installation script to improve ease-of-use and have modified it a few times since to make its compatibility more universal

# Ancillary Services Development

- Published the first draft of the new 01coin website to [GitHub](https://github.com/zocteam/website); still needs a few minor tweaks before it can be deployed live to [01coin.io](https://01coin.io/)
- Completed the Graviex integration into the [official explorer](https://explorer.01coin.io/coininfo) to show current values in ZOC and BTC; USD still missing, though, because explorer takes that from coinmarketcap
- Launched a new backup explorer in partnership with [AltExplorer.co](https://altexplorer.co/coin/zoc)

<p style="text-align: center;">The 01coin AltExplorer also includes live exchange integration with Crex24 and Graviex</p>

- Fixed wallet API for the Discord bot to get current data
- Added status of "Listening to !help" to Discord bot to make it clearer to users how they can interact with her
- Added a "+" symbol to the Discord bot's !market response when there has been a positive change

# 01VPS.net Updates

- Added new one-click auto masternode setup recipes for Oyster Platform, Scribe, Rapture and Global Token
- 01coin recipe updated to include auto Sentinel installation for both new and existing masternodes
- Temporarily suspended new service availability while the 01VPS.net datacentre reviews our justification for requiring more IPv4 addresses
