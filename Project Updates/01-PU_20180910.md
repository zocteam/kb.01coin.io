Welcome once again to 01coin's Anthology of Activity - our biweekly project update. Obviously, the big news over the past two weeks was our new wallet release, 01coin v0.12.3.2 on August 30. Don't forget this was a *mandatory* update - so upgrade your local *and* masternode wallets immediately if you haven't already.

New wallet release notwithstanding, there has been a lot of other developments within the project as well. Have a read to catch yourself up, and see if you can spot news about a surprise we have in store for the community!

# Community Updates

- Added a new exchange presence at [Ubit.pw](https://ubit.pw/markets/zocbtc); Although there is no volume on the exchange yet, already about 2.5 masternodes' worth of ZOC has been traded on it - so don't sleep on the arbitrage opportunities that are starting to pop up for ZOC between [Graviex](https://graviex.net/markets/zocbtc), [Ubit](https://ubit.pw/markets/zocbtc), [Bisq](https://markets.bisq.network/?market=zoc_btc) and - later this month - [CryptalDash](https://www.cryptaldash.com/go)
- CryptalDash listing still on schedule to go live September 21
- Launched our first [Gleam campaign](https://gleam.io/VgCdZ/01-coin-lets-spread-the-word-about-zoc) to promote our Twitter and Facebook accounts as well as [01VPS.net](https://01vps.net/)

<p style="text-align: center;">Enter our gleam contest for a chance to win 500 ZOC!</p>

- Added a new masternode monitoring listing at [NodeCheck.io](https://nodecheck.io/currency/ZOC) (arguably the most feature-rich MN monitoring service available) thanks in no small part to the generous contributions of 01coin community member FreakHouse and NodeCheck's own iwalker - Thanks fellas!

<p style="text-align: center;">NodeCheck.io offers your choice of light or dark themes</p>

- Added a new market monitoring listing at [coincodex.com](https://coincodex.com/crypto/01-coin/) thanks to the initiative shown by 01coin Chain of Trust member, Keith
- Discovered our Facebook and Twitter accounts had become unlinked, so Facebook had not been updated in a couple weeks; Caught Facebook up with the latest posts and will use Hootsuite going forward to crosspost on both platforms
- Completed internal first draft of the Project Whitepaper; after a round of proofreading, the draft will be shared among the zocteam for feedback
- Co-marketing effort alongside [01VPS.net](https://01vps.net/), targeting the Gravium, VIOG, Scribe, and Oyster Platform communities
- Continued to run the community content creation competition (4C) for *"How to Register on Graviex and Start Trading ZOC"* - NB: The prize for creating 'acceptable' YouTube content is one masternode
- Provided some market-making support for the [Bisq](https://bisq.network/) offer book; 01coin remains consistently in the Top 5 coins on Bisq in terms of open offers

# Wallet and Core Development

- Released [01coin v0.12.3.2](https://github.com/zocteam/zeroonecoin/releases/tag/v0.12.3.2), which brings the 01coin core up-to-date with the latest development included in both Bitcoin 0.16.2 and Dash 0.12.3.2

*Please note this is a mandatory update, so please upgrade your wallets immediately if you have not already done so*

- Release occurred as planned and on schedule August 30, thanks to the cooperation of the exchanges, the pool admins and of course, the 01coin masternode network
