For many of us, the days are getting warmer and longer. Some may be having to shut down or reduce their mining operations. But the 01coin project keeps humming along regardless. Let's bring ourselves up-to-date with the latest news from the 01coin Community with this Anthology of Activity: the 01coin Project Update.

# Community Updates

- As you may already know, Discord is the primary hub for 01coin Community engagement. Recently, Discord added a new feature called "Server Boosting." This is a feature that allows those with a Discord Nitro subscription to "boost" their favourite server. There are three boost levels, and Level 1 only requires two community members to boost the server, thus offering additional perks to all community members, as outlined below:

- If you have a Discord Nitro subscription and love 01coin as much as we do, please consider giving our Discord server a boost: https://discord.gg/wq5xD6M

- Our most recent application for listing on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) was denied because they considered our trade volume on a 2nd exchange (i.e., [Crex24](https://crex24.com/exchange/ZOC-BTC) or [CryptalDash](https://exchange.cryptaldash.com/)) to be "immaterial." In an effort to improve that in time for another application attempt soon, stay tuned into our social media channels in the coming weeks for the announcement of a possible trading competition that the zocteam has begun to contemplate.

# Wallet and Core Development

- Active development on our next wallet release, 01coin v0.12.3.5 is now in full tilt. Minor improvements in the new release include:

> - Corrections to some inconsistencies in copyright dates
> - Renaming 0.00000001 units of a ZOC "zuffs"
> - Continued improvement and customization of unit tests
> - Increase maximum InstantSend value from 1000 to 10000 ZOC
> - Make Sentinel required to receive masternode rewards
> - Improve the verbosity of in-wallet masternode count stats

- The major improvement we are working towards in v0.12.3.5, though, is the enabling of IPv6 masternodes. Enabling IPv6 masternodes will require a change in 01coin's consensus rules, so when v0.12.3.5 is released it will be a mandatory upgrade including an updated protocol version. Thus, at a certain yet-to-be-determined block height, all pre-v0.12.3.5 nodes will be kicked from the network. 

- Also note that Sentinel will be required as of v0.12.3.5. Currently, masternodes in SENTINEL_PING_EXPIRED status continue to receive rewards - but that will no longer be that case.

# Ancillary Services Development

- The 01coin Knowledge Base has been completed and will be added to the new [01coin.io](https://01coin.io/) website soon. Included in the Knowledge Base will be all project-related documents in the following categories:

> - Official Documents
> - Roadmap
> - Guides & Tutorials
> - Project Updates
> - Meeting Minutes
> - About This Knowledge Base

- The source for the 01coin Knowledge Base is open and it can already be viewed here: https://github.com/zocteam/kb.01coin.io. Feel free to submit an issue if you have any questions, comments or suggestions for additional content.

- New Discord bot features have been merged into master to update the welcome message for new community members, improve the !price command to pull from [Crex24](https://crex24.com/exchange/ZOC-BTC) and [CryptalDash](https://exchange.cryptaldash.com/) as well as the currently-existing pull from [Graviex](https://graviex.net/markets/zocbtc), and the add a !value N command to return the current market value of N ZOC in Bitcoin. These new features are still undergoing testing, but should be installed on 01coin's Discord server soon.
